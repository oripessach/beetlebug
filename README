Beetlebug is a Yocto based Linux system designed to be used as a simple IoT edge device for accessing
RTSP video cameras behind a firewall, by establishing a Wireguard VPN connection to a cloud server
and running an RTSP proxy on the VPN IP address. 

Use cases include running cloud based DVR software, gaining remote access to firewall protected 
IP cameras as well as other situations where one might need to establish an RTSP connection with 
an IP camera that's on a private network.

It is very much a work in progress, and isn't currently expected to do much without a lot of manual
configuration. Documentation on how to perform such configuration is currently non-existent.
